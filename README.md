# Computer *Science* Papers & Talks
This is a list of actual Computer **Science** Papers and Talks, related to multiple subjects that are of my interest. Most of them relates to *Functional Programming* or *Programming Language Theory*.
For the purpose of this file, the term *PL*" and "*Programming Language*" will be used interchangeably .
